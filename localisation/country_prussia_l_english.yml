Firece_Revanchism:0 "Fierce Revanchism"
Firece_Revanchism_desc:0 "Ever since the days of Freidrich II Germany has been disunited by squabbling princes. Many tried to save Germany from the corrupt princes but were stopped by the greatest traitors, Austria. They had a chance to become part of something greater than themselves and instead destroyed the dreams of patriots everywhere. They must die for Germany to live, down with the traitors, up with the eagle!"

Mackensen_Reforms:0 "Mackensen's Army Reforms"
Mackensen_Reforms_desc:0 "The venerable Chief of Staff August von Mackensen is a genius. He reestablished the old principles of total military discipline and joined it to the new principles of fanaticism and mass warfare. The Prussian military is the best on the continent and will crush all who dare oppose it. Prussia is and has always been an army with a state."

Revolutionary_Treason:0 "Revolutionary Treason"
Revolutionary_Treason_desc:0 "In the years leading up to our glorious National Revolution, both our party and the Communist Party grew in popularity. While we have tried to destroy them they just keep coming back. If we don’t destroy Luksemburg’s band of terrorists soon they could undo all we have worked for. For the safety of Prussia they must be...disposed of.\n\n§RGoering's rule will not be secured until Luxemburg's band of radicals is broken up§!"

Firece_Revanchism_2:0 "Fierce Revanchism"
GER_Clash_Of_The_Militias:0 "Clash of the Militias"
GER_Clash_Of_The_Militias_desc:0 "The militias of the Anti-Spartacist alliance have become staunch rivals. The Sturmabeiltung, our personal militia, have expanded massively since Operation Hummingbird. The increasingly radical leader of the SA, Ernst Rohm, is advocating the destruction of all "medieval" structures and the establishment of a Futurist, Spartan state. This view has made them increasingly rowdy, rapacious, and worst, disloyal to the Reichsmarshall. Rohm especially is becoming a major threat.\nThe second problem is the Freikorps. Formed as a reactionary, nationalist organization in the wake of Luxemburg's abortive revolution, they fought side by side with the Wehrmacht and SA against her partisans. After the death of their political supporters in Operation Hummingbird, they were theoretically integrated with the Wehrmacht, but their reactionary, Volkisch nature was maintained. Led by August von Mackensen, they are on the outs with the regime but might be persuaded to really it - if the SA are removed. While the SA think of the Freikorps as reactionary traitors - and they may be, given the recent Fuhrerdammerung - the Freikorps consider the SA lowborn wretches as bad as the Spartacists. What's more, the Freikorps has strong Wehrmacht support, and angering one will anger the other."

GER_bismarcks_broken_dream:0 "Bismarck's Broken Dream"
GER_bismarcks_broken_dream_desc:0 "Chancellor Otto von Bismarck had a dream, a dream of German unity under the Prussian eagle. Betrayed by the European powers and our supposed brothers, he failed, dying a broken man. We will always remember him as the man who tried to gain unity, and hope that one day, his broken dream will be realized. Fur das Vaterland!\n\n§RUntil we achieve German Unification, Bismarck's dream will remain broken§!"

 germany.5433.t:0 "Containing the Militias Event Body"
 germany.5433.d:0 " The militias of the Anti-Spartacist alliance have become staunch rivals. The Sturmabeiltung, our personal militia, have expanded massively since Operation Hummingbird. The increasingly radical leader of the SA, Ernst Rohm, is advocating the destruction of all "medieval" structures and the establishment of a Futurist, Spartan state. This view has made them increasingly rowdy, rapacious, and worst, disloyal to the Reichsmarshall. Rohm especially is becoming a major threat.\n The second problem is the Freikorps. Formed as a reactionary, nationalist organization in the wake of Luxemburg's abortive revolution, they fought side by side with the Wehrmacht and SA against her partisans. After the death of their political supporters in Operation Hummingbird, they were theoretically integrated with the Wehrmacht, but their reactionary, Volkisch nature was maintained. Led by August von Mackensen, they are on the outs with the regime but might be persuaded to really it - if the SA are removed. While the SA think of the Freikorps as reactionary traitors - and they may be, given the recent Fuhrerdammerung - the Freikorps consider the SA lowborn wretches as bad as the Spartacists. What's more, the Freikorps has strong Wehrmacht support, and angering one will anger the other. \n Waiting will only anger both, so we must destroy one to appease the other. Herr Reichsmarshall, who shall we destroy?"
 germany.5433.a:0 "Rohm is too radical, we can't anger the Wehrmacht. "
 germany.5433.b:0 "The Freikorps are traitors, we must fulfill the National Revolution!"
