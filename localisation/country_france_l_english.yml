FRENCH_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After the death of Napoleon III in 1873, Napoleon IV in 1898, Napoleon V in 1926, Napoleon VI took over and promulgated a constitution, more liberal than the previous. Riding high on support gained from this, he has ruled justly and fostered a strong emigre community and a sense of nationalism in the people. After the German Revolution of 1930, France annexed the Rhineland, and the combination of these two factors has made Napoleon VI highly popular. As France gears up for war with the fascists, the Empire of Austria, and the British, Napoleon VI serves as a rallying point for Frenchmen everywhere. Vive la France!"

NAPOELEON_DESC:0 "Louis Jerome Victor Emmanuel Leopold Marie, or Napoleon VI, has led an interesting life. Born in Paris in 1914 on the eve of the Europakrieg, his formative years were spent looking at the damage to Europe from that war. His aversion to the vicious slaughter contrasted sharply with the family’s penchant for warmongering. With his father busy running the country, his nanny until age 6 was the ancient Dowager Empress Eugenie, wife of Napoleon III the Restorer. After her death in 1920, Louis was sent off to the prestigious Leuven Elementary School. His education was interrupted by the death of his father in 1926, causing the regency of the Empress Clementine. His tutor during these years was esteemed liberal politician Gaston Domergue, and after ascending the throne in 1929, Domergue’s influence caused the Emperor to sign the Constitution of 1927, which made male adult suffrage near universal and expanded the right to protest, though the Emperor was still the central figure of the Constitution. Shortly after this, Napoleon was shocked when he faced the Rocque Putsch, led by Colonel Francois de la Rocque and right-wing officers opposed to the Constitution. While well respected Field Marshal Phillipe Petain decried the insurrection, he is well known to have sympathy for de la Rocque. Napoleon’s anger knew no bounds when he heard that de la Rocque’s men had shot Domergue, who the Emperor had appointed Prime Minister. The aggrieved Emperor angered Petain by ordering the conspirators to be summarily shot. The loss of Domergue caused Napoleon to retreat from politics and made him question the Constitution he had agreed to, especially after the rise of the SFIO and Radical Party. The Emperor’s political hiatus ended in 1933 when, fearing the defeat of his friend and Prime Minister Pierre Laval’s government, he personally appealed to the French people to support Laval. The Emperor’s popularity caused a decisive win for Laval, but alienated the Radicals and Socialists to the point where they formed the Cartel de Gauche to oppose Laval, and extremism heightened, with the Dowager Empress Clementine almost being assassinated by an anarchist. The Emperor wanted to restore the 1852 Constitution, but he was unable to because Edouard Daladier’s left wing of the Doctrinaire (popularly referred to as the Dynastic Left) threatened to join the Cartel if such a move was taken. Since the withdrawal of the Dynastic Left would destroy the Doctrinaire majority, the Emperor was unable to restore his old powers. Parliament became ever more fractious, with the SFIO radicals on the one hand and the new Mouvement Anticonstitutionaliste et Integraliste, led by a Duumvirate of Charles Maurras and Marcel Bucard, and with ties to Petain. While the Emperor had been infuriated at the Rocque Putsch, he now reconciled with the Marechal, and right wing officers have joined the Emperor’s inner circle. The issue of the refugees has become ever more problematic, with the Emperor officially undecided. Though his tumultuous life and reign had forced him to grow up fast, he is still just 22 and could easily change his position. As the cracks spread in the Empire and in Europe, the Emperor is sure of one thing: the Bonapartes will never surrender."

belgian_election_events.5.d:0 "The Campaigns have started for the 1936 Belgian Elections! Now for alittle history on Belgium.\n\nBelgium's history is brief, yet complex. In 1830, the Belgian Revolution led to the separation of the Southern Provinces from the Netherlands and to the establishment of a Catholic and bourgeois, officially French-speaking and neutral, independent Belgium under a provisional government and a national congress. Since the installation of Leopold I as king on 21 July 1831, Belgium has been a constitutional monarchy. The main political parties of the 19th century were the Catholic Party and the Liberal Party. French was originally the single official language adopted by the nobility and the bourgeoisie. However, many people speak Dutch as well.\n\nIt has been under heavy influence from Napoleonic France and Britain; France wants to unite the people of Wallonia under their rule, but the Brits want to secure the Benelux as a place of neutrality in the case of a Prussian invasion from the east, fearing French Ambitions there could disrupt this narrative.\n\nThe 1932 Belgian Elections were extremely controversial, as a well known Integralist Leon Degrelle won. It was not known whether the French Monarchist Supporting Movement Action Francaise intervened, but relations between the French and the British quickly soured. DeGrelle immediately voiced the words of Charles Marras, establishing an integral society. He and Napoleon have been coming close together much to the delight of the Action Francaise and the dismay of the British. Candidate Paul Van Zeeland, a progressive and anti-Degrellist, is supported and funded by Halifax's National Government. Both nations will likely support their favored candidate, and true democracy will likely be sidelined by the great powers. This election will likely decide their fate."

brussells_conference.1.t:0 "The Brussells Conference"
brussells_conference.1.d:0 "The Benelux has long been an area of hot contention between us and the Brits, particulary Belgium.\n\nIt has been under heavy influence from we and Britain; We wants to unite the people of Wallonia under their rule, but the Brits want to secure the Benelux as a place of neutrality in the case of a Prussian invasion from the east, fearing our ambitions there could disrupt this narrative.\n\nThe 1932 Belgian Elections were extremely controversial, as a well known Integralist Leon Degrelle won. It was not known whether the French Monarchist Supporting Movement Action Francaise intervened, but relations between the us and the British quickly soured. Degrelle immediately voiced the words of Charles Marras and restricted freedom of religion. He has been cozying up with Napoleon and promoting Walloonism.\n\nNow that he has won reelection in 1936, we will move forward and call a Conference with them to discuss further relations."
brussells_conference.1.a:0 "They could be quite useful..."

brussells_conference.2.t:0 "Getting Comfy with DeGrelle"
brussells_conference.2.d:0 "Napoleon walked up to Leon DeGrelle with his hand out. He was certainly a funny looking man, with his suit and all. He seemed to be a better fit in the military, one of those tough generals that all the soldiers loved and hated. Then again, he was an incredible speaker. It was no surpise Action Francaise had chosen him as their candidate.\n\n"How are you doing, Emperor? How great it is to meet you!", DeGrelle remarked in a deep voice.\n\n"Napoleon eyed the Press in the distance, snapping picture after picture. He was going to have to handle this situation carefully. Even though the British were busy with their failing empire, they would still hate to see DeGrelle getting too comfy. Then again, this deal would have to be made. The Prussians were expanding fast, and having the Belgians on their side would prove huge difficulties for their armies to move into France, even if they conquered Westfalen.\n\nSo, I get it your Foriegn Minister has told you about our proposal?\n\n"Yes yes he has. And I have thought about it much as well. What do we have to gain from this exactly?"\n\nNapoleon smiled. He had been prepared for this exact question. He went into a long scripted speech about the complex geopolitics of Europe, trade, and more. Towards the end, DeGrelle had begun picking at a scab on his finger, and Napoleon took the cue to cease his lecture.\n\n"Fine, fine, you have convinced me. But I have other matters to attend to. We can talk more tommorrow.\n\nNapoleon gave a sigh of relief. The deed wasn't finished, but he had certainly made progress...at least he thought he had."
brussells_conference.2.a:0 "And tommorrow we will see his decision."

brussells_conference.3.t:0 "DeGrelle's Decision"
brussells_conference.3.d:0 ""We accept," DeGrelle said. "You are right. We need your protection. Now"\n\nNapoleon broke out into a slight smile. DeGrelle was such an easy figure to manipulate. Of course he knew that he would accept.\n\n"Our first act will be to build stronger fortifications, on both the Dutch and Westfalen borders. Next I will encourage our investors to invest in your lands." Napoleon continued with other parts of the plan to further convince DeGrelle to what would be his ultimate goal.\n\n"Sounds good. Anything else you have to say?"\n\\nNapoleon knew it was time. But he would need to proceed carefully. 70 years ago, his ancestor Napoleon III had purchased Luxembourg from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. Now he would be proposing a similar deal to DeGrelle. But it was risky. If the French Buffer State was to be formed, the British would be pissed off. Big time. Napoleon knew he had to..."

brussells_conference.4.d:0 ""Get the fuck out of Here," DeGrelle growled. "I thought this was supposed to be about an alliance, right? How dare you threaten our indepdence."\n\nNapoleon panicked. He had screwed the whole operation up. He had tried his best to explain the benefits of incorporation into a buffer state, but had failsed miserably.\n\n"I was a democratically elected leader. The people placed their trust in me! And now you ask me to betray them?"\n\nNapoleon knew there would be no hope left. He left the room."
brussells_conference.4.a:0 "Goddamn it."

brussells_conference.5.t:0 "And It Succeeds In the End"
brussells_conference.5.d:0 ""Your right," DeGrelle proclaimed. "The Prussians and British are the biggest threats to our independence. Together we shall achieve Greater Belgium!"\n\n Napoleon felt a smile creep to his face. DeGrelle had agreed. What the Britiish would say he didn't know.

francestart.1.d:0 "With the country and the Chambers bitterly divided over the question of refugee citizenship, the Emperor has opted to step in and call for new elections. With luck the new chambers will solve the problem in a level headed manner, hopefully things don’t get too out of hand. " 
francestart.1.a:0 "Election Season is upon us"

francestart.13.t:0 "The Campaign Begins"
francestart.13.d:0 "The two main electoral blocs are the Doctrinaires, a broad group of nationalist constitutional monarchists dedicated to order, and the Leftist Coalition, a coalition of the Radical Party, a liberal party with mainly constitutionalist tendencies, though hosting a strong republican minority, and the SFIO, a socialist trade union that while not strictly a party, holds enormous power. The citizens of France must decide the future of the nation, but going too far to the right or left might result in catastrophe for the country. Btw Doctrinaires are led by Laval, Radicals by Daladier, and SFIO by Blum."
francestart.13.a:0 "A Fierece Competition"

francestart.2.t:0 "The Issue of Refugees"
francestart.2.d:0 "France's Refugee Issue is a complex situation made up of four main groups: Poles, Italians, Hungarians, and Prussians; \nPolish Legions are hardcore soldiers (and families) who are personally loyal to the Bonaparte dynasty but somewhat liberal (constitutionalists); they dislike Prussian exiles, are neutral towards Italian liberals, and have a love-hate relationship with Hungarian revolutionaries.\nPrussian exiles, mostly conservative officers, are loyal to the Doctrinaire party, but despise Poles, Italian liberals and are moderate against Hungarian revolutionaries.\nItalian liberals, most of them are officially liberals though some are secretly anarchists, are sympathetic to liberal republicans and the SFIO; They support Hungarians, dislike Prussians, and are neutral towards Poles.\nHungarian revolutionaries, across the ideological spectrum but generally social democrats aligned with the Leftist Coalition, are fiercely committed to self-determination for all nations; they have a love-hate relationship with the Polish exiles (liberal nationalist brothers and historical friendship, but ideological divergences), support the Italian liberals, and are moderately against Prussian exiles."
francestart.2.a:0 "We Must Choose A Side"

francestart.3.t:0 "The Refugee Bill was rejected"
francestart.3.d:0 "Today, Napoleon walked outside of the Imperial Senate building in Paris and announced that the Refugee Bill to give voting rights to the Hungarians and Italians was struck down. This likely means that the Doctrinaires will prevail in Imperial Elections, with mainly French Conservatives participating."
francestart.3.a:0 "No Civil Rights? Based."

francestart.4.t:0 "The Refugee Bill was accepted"
francestart.4.d:0 "Today, Napoleon walked outside of the Imperial Senate building in Paris and announced that the Refugee Bill to give voting rights to the Hungarians and Italians was accepted by the Senate. This likely means that the Popular Front will prevail in Imperial Elections, with huge surge of SS Leftist Members allowed to vote."
francestart.4.a:0 "Civil Rights? Based."

francestart.5.t:0 "Napoleon Denounces the Left"
francestart.5.d:0 "Napoleon had just finished giving a speech on why France should elect Charles Maurras as mayor of Paris.\n\nIn an unprecedented move for an emperor he had officially denounced the SFIO, calling them terrorists and Jacobins, and has pleaded with the people of France to reject them. By extension he is supporting the Doctrinaire forces against the Leftist Coalition. This has outraged many among the left and even liberal reformists are annoyed at Imperial interference, but Imperial popularity has weakened leftist support. "
francestart.5.a:0 "The Doctrinaires must win!"

francestart.6.t:0 "Napoleon Visits Factories"
francestart.6.d:0 "The Emperor has taken a tour of the Paris factories. He was visibly appalled by the condition of the workers and gave many of them francs, earning him looks of gratitude. The Emperor asked what he could do for them, and was asked to lower their work hours. Before Napoleon could respond, his aide, friends with a wealthy factory owner, hissed in his ear, "The business classes support you, my Emperor. I trust you won’t give in to these preposterous demands?" The Emperor, left in a dilemma, turned to the expectant workers and made some bland promises about future wage increases."
francestart.6.a:0 "Maybe this will stop the strikes...?"

francestart.14.t:0 "Fire In Their Bellies"
francestart.14.d:0  "The workers did not take kindly to the Emperor’s answer. They fulminated, spreading the word of his callous disregard for their plight. One day, it blew over. Tens of thousands of workers took to the streets, denouncing capitalism as oppressive and murderous. The workers are flocking to the SFIO by the thousands. The Emperor looks on in anguish and regret as the Doctrinaire majority looks ever slimmer. "
francestart.14.a:0 "We Cannot Live on Cake!"


francestart.7.t:0 "Operation Savior"
francestart.7.d:0 ""Thank you, my Emperor," Petain said, smiling. "You will not regret this." The Emperor already had his doubts - what if Petain overthrew democracy entirely? - but he was committed now. Petain’s headquarters at Metz were a flurry of activity for several days as conservative officers prepared for a potential civil war. The Emperor made a "troop review" to see for himself the preparations for "war", and what he saw reassured him. Operation Savior was ready.\n\nThe Next Day, with the army at his side, Napoleon forced a decree through parliament increasing his power to essentially prevent the Jacobins from wining. The workers were getting more and more mad."
francestart.7.a:0 "Order over Liberty. Napoleon Rules All!"

francestart.8.t:0 "Napoleon Increases His Power"
francestart.8.d:0 "Today Napoleon signed a decree giving himself more power.

They quickly built a strong presence, but it would come to hurt them in the future.\n\nCommunism was spreading to industrialized countries specifically, and was becoming a problem in France with the creation of the “Parti de la liberté des Travailleurs, a radical socialist revolutionary communist party which had taken part in multiple terrorist attacks and bombings against Right-Wing groups. With growing French resentment of the Left, France would watch as far-leftists would do the unthinkable in Westfalen, using their positions in the government to launch a coup and hold the King, Karl Josef Bonaparte, a member of Napoleon’s family hostage. The subsequent Napoleonic invasion led to the rise of Lord Regent Charles De Gaulle, who installed a strict law code known as "Neue Code Napoleon".\n\nThe reformed Code Napoleon is very enlightened and has helped stabilize Westfalen, but has caused a fervent rise in opposition the De Gaulle and the King's rule."
